TPS 1

1. Perform a search on the Internet on the difference(s) between the terms procedures, functions, and 
methods.
---
Procedure - has no return value
Function - can have a return value
Method - functions internal to classes/objects


2. As we have learned in lectures, our compiled program is stored in the static part of the memory when it 
is being executed. When the CPU runs a program, it executes the statements according to the statement 
order (line numbers). Unless there is a branch (beq/bne) or jump (j/jal) statement, it will just 
execute the next statement.
---



3. Load proc1.s in MARS and study the MIPS program without assembling and running it. Write an 
equivalent program in C and name it proc1.c. You can treat m and n as variables declared in main.
---



4. In proc1.s, we use j SUM to ask the CPU to jump to the line with the label SUM and continue 
running the program from there. What line number is this (i.e., the line number pointed to by label 
SUM)? What does this line do?
---
Line 20


5. After function SUM is over, the program is supposed to return to the line after j SUM. In the code, jr 
$ra is used. Can we use j instead (assuming we can create a label for that line)? 
---



6. Since the return address keeps changing depending on where SUM is called, we need to save the return 
address before SUM is called. At what line in proc1.s is the return address supposed to be saved? In 
what register is the address saved to? What is the value of address being saved here? Does this address 
value make sense?
---
Invalid program counter value at address 0


7. Assemble the code and open the Execute tab. Here the program is listed in the Text Segment (as we have 
seen this in last lab). What happens when you try to run the program? This error is due to the invalid 
return address (program counter tells the CPU where to look for a statement).
---



8. Now, let us correct the return address value. From the Text Segment window, what is the address of the 
statement that the program should return to from SUM?
---



9. Modify the code so the correct return address is saved. Assemble it and look at the Text Segment again. 
(DO NOT execute it yet!) Double check the return address. Is it correct? What happened? You will 
know more about what happened here in later lectures.
---



10. What is the new return address? Modify your code, assemble, and run the program. What is the output 
of the program?
---



11. As you can see, saving the correct return address before each procedure call is tedious. It would be nice 
if the assembler can do it for us! Instead of using j to call a procedure, what operator should we use? 
---



12. Modify the code so you do not use j to call SUM. Make sure to comment out the line where the 
return address is saved (with your modifications from earlier steps).
---



TPS 2

1. Study proc2.c and trace the program. What will be the output if you run the program? Compile and 
run proc2.c in a terminal (or any IDE) and verify your answer.
---



2. Load proc2.s in MARS. This is the MIPS version of proc2.c. Do not assemble and run this 
program, as there are errors due to the misuse of registers. Study the MAIN function and discuss with 
your partners about what it does (compare it with the C version).
---



3. When MAIN calls SUM, SUM knows where to return to. Why? After SUM called SUB, what happens to the 
address returning to MAIN? Discuss with your partners about how you would resolve this problem.  Do 
not attempt to fix it yet, as we have more problems to come.
---



4. The input argument (n) in function SUM is used to call the next function, SUB, as well as being added to 
the return value. According to the register convention, the first argument of all function calls must be 
stored in $a0. From line 27 of proc2.s, the value in $a0 is no longer the same as the input argument 
of SUM (it has been changed to store input argument of SUB). We can resolve this problem by saving the 
original $a0 into a temporary register, but we may eventually run out of registers if our program is large. 
Discuss with your partners about how you would resolve this problem. Do not attempt to fix it yet.
---



5. Have a look at line 24. What happens to the original value in $s0 from MAIN after this statement is 
executed? Is this a problem? Why? Discuss with your partners about how you would fix this problem. 
Do not attempt to fix it yet.
---



6. Now we know that SUM needs to backup 3 values before calling SUB. Insert prologue and epilogue into 
the code so the program will run correctly. (Hint: study function SUB, as it does not contain any errors)
