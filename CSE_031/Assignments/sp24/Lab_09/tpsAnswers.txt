TPS 1

1. Download “MIPS_Reference_Sheet” from CatCourses. We will need to refer to this sheet to 
complete all the exercises in this lab.
---


2. Load proc1.s in MARS and study the code. This is similar to compare.s from Lab 06.
---


3. After assembling the program, study the Text Segment window and see how your source code is 
translated into True Assembly Language (Basic) as well as machine code (Code).
---


4. In true assembly language, every single instruction can be translated into a machine instruction. How 
many bits does a machine instruction contain?
---


5. To utilize the limited number of bits efficiently, all machine instructions are categorized into different 
types (or formats). How many types are there? What are they? Give 2 operations for each type as 
examples.
---


6. Now, locate the instruction in line #7 of proc1.s. Let us translate this instruction into machine code.  
a. What instruction type is this? How many fields does this type of instruction have? What are the
names of these fields?
---


b. Refer to the MIPS sheet, what is the value of the opcode of this instruction in hex? What register 
is rs? What is the value of this register in hex? What register is rt? What is the value of this register 
in hex? What is the value of immediate in hex?
---


c. Construct the machine code of line #7 using the values obtained from part b. Write your answer in 
both binary and hex formats. You can verify your answer with the Code column in Text Segment 
window.
---


7. Now, let us convert a machine code to a MIPS instruction. Locate address 0x00400010 from the Text 
Segment window.
a. What is the machine code at this address in hex? Convert this code into binary.
---


b. From the binary version of this machine code. What is the instruction type? How can you tell? How 
many fields are there in this instruction type? What are the names of these fields?
---


c. According to the binary machine code, what is the value of each field in hex?
---


d. Refer to the MIPS sheet, what operation is this instruction? How can you tell? What is the mapping 
of the registers being used in this instruction?
---


e. What is the final MIPS instruction? Is it the same as the Source Column in the Text Segment 
window?
---


8. Now, let us take a look at line #17 of proc1.s.
a. What format is this instruction?
---


b. What are the values of opcode, rs, and rt of this instruction in hex?
---


c. What is the name of the target label if it takes the branch? What is the address of this label in hex? 
(Hint: you can find it in the Text Segment window.)
---


d. So, do we put this address as the value of the immediate field of the instruction? Why?
---


e. How do we find the value of the immediate field? What is this value?
---


f. What is the machine code of this instruction in binary and hex formats? Does your answer match 
the Code column in the Text Segment window?
---


9. Finally, let us convert the j instruction in line #20.
a. What format is this instruction? How many fields are there in this format?
---


b. What is the opcode of this instruction in hex?
---


c. To what label and address does this instruction jump?
---


d. How many bits can you use in the address field of the instruction? How can we “squeeze” the 
address into this field? What are the reasons behind this approach? What is the value of the 
address field in binary?
---


e. What is the machine code of this instruction in binary and hex? Is it the same as what’s in the 
Code Column of the Text Segment window?
